    "# Homework - HI in galaxies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim: \n",
    "\n",
    "Practice opening \".fits\" files, analysing 3D data and investigating HI properties of galaxies using an Ipython notebook (or google collab notebook).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Email me the Ipython notbook (or google collab notebook) of the solution to hdenes@yachaytech.edu.ec by <b>Monday the 16th of January (Midnight).</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Late submission will be penalised by point deduction. I will deduct 1 point for each day for late submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Each point in the exercise is worth 1 point. Total points for the Homework: 12. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I should be able to execute the notebook and there should be answers to all of the points in the exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please be aware that homework is meant to be individual. <b>Identical homeworks will be graded 0. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources: \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to find all relevant information in the tutorial notebook: \n",
    "https://github.com/helgadenes/Astrophysics_yachay/blob/main/Example_Code/3D_data_cube_tutorial/3D_data_cubes_tutorial.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find background information on HI in galaxies in the slides: https://github.com/helgadenes/Astrophysics_yachay/blob/main/Slides/Astro_5.1.pdf \n",
    "\n",
    "A very good resource for a more complete description of radio spectral lines can be found here: https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch7.html \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions you can also ask me. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise: \n",
    "\n",
    "Analise the 3D HI data cube of the galaxy NGC 4321. Each point is worth 1 point. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the 3D HI data cube from the survey website: http://www.astro.yale.edu/cgi-bin/viva/galaxy.cgi?ngc4321 (Download the \"Cleaned cube\"). Don't forget to unzip the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is data from the VLA Imaging of Virgo in Atomic gas (VIVA) suvey. This is an interferometric survey of galaxies in the Virgo galaxy cluster, with the aim to map the HI in spiral galaxies in the cluster and analyse how the cluster environment affects the HI content of the galaxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read in the data from the 3D data file. (If you are using google collab: upload the data cube to google drive, so that you can load it with google collab.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mask the noise in the data cube (mask data below 5 times the rms in the data cube).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make a moment 0 map (integrated intensity map) of the galaxy. This should look similar to the top image on the webpage of the data. You can obviously use a color map that you like.   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make an overlay of HI contours (the integrated intensity map) on a UV image (you can use the GALEX near UV data from SkyView for the UV image). A list of survey names for SkyView is here: https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/skyview/skyview.html\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Make a moment 1 map (velocity field) of the galaxy. (This can either have units of frequency or velocity, the two are equivalent)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Make a plot of the HI line profile of the galaxy. This is amplitude vs velocity integrating the data in the spatial dimensions (R.A. and Dec.). Make sure to use the masked data, that does not have any noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Check the 3rd axis (the velocity or frequency) type. If it is in frequency than you should convert the frequency to velocity in km/s. An option to do this is to use astropy equivalencies (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/equivalencies.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "restfreq = 1.420405 * u.GHz  # rest frequency HI in GHz\n",
    "\n",
    "freq_to_vel = u.doppler_radio(restfreq)\n",
    "\n",
    "x_axis_2 = (x_axis * u.Hz).to(u.km / u.s, equivalencies=freq_to_vel) # this will convert an array (x_axis) that has the frequency axis values in Hz into velocity axis values in km/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Calculate the integrated HI intesnity of the galaxy. Make sure the units are in Jy and km/s. For this you will need the beam size in pixels. The way to get this is in the tutorial notebook. The beam size of the data cube is 15.90\" X 14.66\" in arcseconds. This information is also available on the webpage of the data. The beam size in radio astronomy is representing the spatial resolution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the systemic velocity of this galaxy? Estimate it from the HI line profile plot. What Hubble flow distance would this correspond to?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Calculate the HI mass of the galaxy. For this use a distance of 16 Mpc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Virgo cluster is the closest galaxy cluster to us. Only 16 Mpc away, and our galaxy group, the Local Group is falling towards the Virgo cluster, which means that the Hubble flow distances for galaxies in the Virgo cluster are going to be inacurate. The peculair motion of the galaxies is relatively large compared to the motion that is due to the expansion of the Universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Would it be possible to estimate the dynamical mass of this galaxy from the HI spectra? Shortly explain your answere.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Is the HI content of this galaxy regular compared to typical spiral galxies? Shortly explain your answere.\n",
    "\n"
